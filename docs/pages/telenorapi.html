    "description" : "<h3><a name=\"authentication\">Authentication</a></h3>\n<p>Parts of the API requires authentication, in order to reliably identify the\n            user to a specific customer record. In this initial version, the API uses HTTP\n            BASIC authentication with username and password. The API offers a number of\n            methods to assist in building the username and password registration flow as\n            well as convenience methods to help recover lost passwords.\n        </p>\n        <p>As an option, API access may also be guarded with a subscription, requiring\n            the authenticated customer to hold an active subscription on multi-screen\n            devices to gain access.\n        </p>\n        <p>Unauthenticated users can use other parts of the API anonymously, e.g. to\n            retrieve EPG programming data and other, non-personalized information.\n        </p>\n        <p>Some services in the API are “personal” and hence require authentication, while others are\n        consideret public, and may be accessed anonymously. A few services may be accessed both ways,\n        and support extra features in the authenticated version. E.g., the channels service can be\n        queried anonymously, to retrieve the selection of available channels, but if it is called\n        with authentication and an extra query parameter, it can also be used to determine exactly which\n        channels can be viewed with respect to the customer's current subscriptions profile.</p>\n        <p>All requests that require authentication use the URI containing <strong>…/auth/rs/…</strong>.\n        Anonymous requests use <strong>…/rs/…</strong>.\n        </p>\n        <dl>\n            <dt>…/client-portal/rs</dt>\n            <dd>For anonymous calls. Responses may be cached in a shared manner, e.g. by\n            a proxy cache, returning the same cached content to different clients. Authentication\n            headers, if present, are ignored.</dd>\n            <dt>…/client-portal/auth/rs</dt>\n            <dd>For authenticated calls. HTTP Basic Authentication headers are validated\n            against the FokusOn customer login tables. Cached responses should not be shared\n            by different clients.</dd>\n        </dl>\n        <p>\n            The services Servlet is configured for HTTP Basic Authentication using a standard\n            Base64 encoded string containing the userid and password. There two user\n            roles configured for access: 'Customer' and 'Device'. Any authenticated user will possess one\n            of these roles and have access to perform the HTTP operations listed below.\n            The client will be authenticated as 'Customer' if username and password correspond to the\n            Weblogin. If username is the deviceId and the password is the access key then the client will\n            be authenticated as Device.\n            BE AWARE: We recommend to be authenticated as 'Device' because it's the most precise authentication\n            and some of the api's requires the userrole 'Device'.\n            In order to get access to deviceId and accessKey do the following:\n            <ol>\n                <li>POST /auth/rs/device/register2 (authenticated as Customer)</li>\n                <li>Use the returned device object (id and accessKey) for future authentication</li>\n            </ol>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <i>BE AWARE:</i><br/> If an authenticated call does not have valid credentials the response            will contain the header: 'WWW-Authenticate'.\n            This can be supressed by adding request header: 'X-Requested-With' = 'XMLHttpRequest'\n        </p><br/>\n        <h3><a name=\"marshalling\">JSON or XML</a></h3>\n        <p><b><i>From version 3.20.0 the fokusOn REST api will ONLY have full support for JSON.</i></b></p>        <p>Most services accept input and produce output in either XML or JSON format. The choice\n        is left to the client, controlled by the 'Content-Type:' header to announce the input format,\n        and the 'Accept:' header to request the output format.</p>\n        <p>XML format is indicated by the MIME type string 'application/xml'.</p>\n        <p>JSON format is indicated by the MIME type string 'application/json'.</p>\n        <p>(... check out the <a href=\"#xsd_grammars\">Grammars</a> section below...)</p>\n        <p>Uses <a href=\"http://jersey.java.net/\">Jersey</a> version ${jersey-release-version}.</p>\n        <br/>        <h3><a name=\"Date format\">Date formats</a></h3>\n        <p>By default the date time format is yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss+HH:oo</p>\n        <p>The legend for the time format is:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>y: Year</li>\n            <li>M: Month</li>\n            <li>d: Day</li>\n            <li>h: Hour</li>\n            <li>m: Minute</li>\n            <li>s: Second</li>\n            <li>H: Time zone hour</li>\n            <li>o: Time zone minute</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The dates in JSON format can be changed to be represented as long, this can be done by applying\n        X-DATE_AS_LONG header with the value true</p>\n        <br/>        <h3><a name=\"error_handling\">Error handling</a></h3>\n        <p>Many services have one or more error modes, in addition to the 'normal' mode. Error modes\n        include cases of regular use such as data validation failures, insufficient access privileges, etc.\n        as well as system level cases such as multi-user interference, system resource exhaustion, time-outs,\n        etc.\n        All cases are reported using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\">standard\n        HTTP status codes</a>, possibly with extra error information returned in custom HTTP headers and/or\n        the response body itself.</p>\n        <dl>\n            <dt>Normal mode</dt>\n            <dd><p>In regular, successful use, all services return one of the\n            <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success\">2xx Success</a> or\n            <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection\">3xx Redirection</a> codes.\n            GET methods will always return either 200 OK, or 304 Not Modified if called with an 'if modified since'\n            condition.</p>\n            <p>POST and PUT methods may also return 201 Created together with a Location header for the address of\n            the newly created entity.</p>\n            <p>DELETE methods may also return 204 No Content.</p>\n            </dd>\n            <dt>User/Application level errors</dt>\n            <dd><p>Error conditions reported from the application business logic will always return one of the\n            <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error\">4xx Error</a> codes,\n            either as a self-descriptive code, where the cause of the failure is evident, e.g. 401 Unauthorized, 404\n            Not Found, etc., or as the more generic 400 Bad Request, accompanied by an error message identifier and\n            zero or more error message parameters, returned in 'X-Message-Key/-Param' custom HTTP response headers.</p>\n            </dd>\n            <dt>System level errors</dt>\n            <dd>Error conditions outside of the application business logic, reported from the application server itself,\n            or from the intermediary network and load balancing equipment, will usually be reported by one of the\n            <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_Error\">5xx Server Error</a> codes,\n            or by some exceptional client-side condition, depending on the API client library being used, the details of\n            which is beyond the scope of this document.\n            </dd>\n        </dl>\n        <br/>        <h3><a name=\"pagination\">Pagination</a></h3>\n        <p>Pagination is supported on some of the service methods.  Currently, there are two types of pagination\n            metaphors implemented: random access and sequential.  The random-access was implemented as first, but due its\n            limitations the sequential-access mechanism was implemented later.  Any pageable service methods that use\n            the Random Access pagination can be expected to be changed to use the Sequential pagination in the future.\n         </p>\n        <h5><a name=\"random-access-pagination\">Random-Access Pagination</a></h5>\n        <p> There are two additional query parameters\n            that any such method recognizes: \"start\" and \"limit\".  The \"start\" parameter allows the client to skip\n            over the given number of items, meanwhile the \"limit\" parameter determines the maximum number of items\n            to be returned.  The default values are 0 for \"start\" and 'all' for \"limit\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Invalid numeric values for these query parameters will be ignored and the method will use the default values.\n            Non-numeric values will cause an HTTP 404 error.\n        </p>\n        <h5><a name=\"sequential-pagination\">Sequential Pagination</a></h5>\n        <p> There are two additional, optional query parameters\n            that any such method recognizes: \"pgSize\" and \"pg\".  The \"pgSize\" parameter determines the page size - i.e.,\n            the maximum number of items to be returned.  The \"pg\" parameter conveys the paging context, and generally it is not\n            expected to be generated by the client.  Instead, the client is should follow the HATEOAS principle\n            and use pre-generated URIs which already contain this parameter.  These URIs can be obtained from the response headers;\n            here is an example of a set of URIs obtained from the response:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Link-Next: /client-portal/rs/vod/shops/11/prices?pg=f95511&amp;pgSize=10&amp;currency=DKK</li>\n                <li>Link-Prev: /client-portal/rs/vod/shops/11/prices?pg=b95471&amp;pgSize=10&amp;currency=DKK</li>\n                <li>Link-First: /client-portal/rs/vod/shops/11/prices?pg=f&amp;pgSize=10&amp;currency=DKK</li>\n                <li>Link-Last: /client-portal/rs/vod/shops/11/prices?pg=b&amp;pgSize=10&amp;currency=DKK</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Depending on the user action (Link-Next, Link-Prev, etc.), the client would then just have to pick and use the corresponding\n            link for the next request - without having to construct the URI.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If the \"pgSize\" parameter is not specified, the paging mechanism is not engaged and all results are returned.\n        </p>\n        <br/>        <h3><a name=\"views\">Result Views</a></h3>\n        <p>Some of the services support multiple views of JSON results; that is the result can be richer or less rich\n            in terms of properties included in the result.  In some situations the caller may want to get all the\n            properties in others less might be sufficient and it might be desirable to limit the amount of data to be\n            processed on the client.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Currently, the following views are defined:\n            <ul>\n                <li>DEFAULT</li>\n                <li>MINIMAL</li>\n                <li>SMALL</li>\n                <li>EXTENDED</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If a view different from DEFAULT is to be applied, this should be requested via a HTTP request header.\n            <br>Example:</br>\n        </p>\n        <p>X-Result-View: SMALL</p>\n        <p>Services that support multiple views list the views in their respective service descriptions.</p>\n        <h3><a name=\"deviceNotificationEvents\">Device Notification Events</a></h3>\n        <p>\n        The services under <a href=\"#recordingplans\">recordingplans</a> and <a href=\"#/recordings2\">recordings2</a>\n        that result in changes in scheduling of recording plans or recordings take an\n        additional parameter \"notificationType\" parameter, passed in as an HTTP header: \"X-Notification-Type\".  It\n        can have the following values:\n        <ul>\n            <li>INSTANT - causes an xmpp message to be sent out</li>\n            <li>HEARTBEAT - causes a heartbeat event to be sent out</li>\n            <li>NONE - no notification will be issued</li>\n            <li>DEFAULT - use INSTANT for cPVR and HEARTBEAT for nPVR</li>\n        </ul>\n        In case the notification type header is not specified, the default behavior applied is DEFAULT.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        If an INSTANT notification is to be sent out as a part of the service execution, and it is determined\n        that this is not possible to do (for example because the target device is not present, etc.) then\n        the service execution will fail with an HTTP 503 (Service unavailable) status, and the intended operation\n        will not be carried out.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Depending on the result of the operation the following events can be sent:\n            <ul>\n                <li>onRecordingPlansUpdated - in case a recording plan has been affected (created, updated, deleted)</li>\n                <li>onRecordingsUpdated - sent when the operation has caused changes in one or more scheduled recordings</li>\n                <li>onRecordingChanged - details the change at the individual recording level: provides information\n                    about the originator, the type of \"crud\" operation that took place, and references to the recording.\n                    Here is an example payload for this event type:\n                    <code>{'initiator':'ab:cd:ef:00:00:02', 'CRUD':'CREATED', 'crId':2851, 'rId':2829}}</code>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>",
